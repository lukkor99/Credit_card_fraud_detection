# Credit Card Fraud Detection | Logistic Regression 

## Project scope
<p align="justify">
  I've created simple binnary classifier in Python3 which uses logisitc regression algorithm to classify two classes of credit card transactions<p>
    
1. fraud transactions
2. non-fraud transactions

<p align="justify"> Techniques and tools used to improve model's performance:
<p>
    
  * undersampling and oversampling
  * feature selection
  * standardization
  * ROC and AUC
  * logistic regressioin metrics
  
  
## Motivation
  
<p align="justify"> Project created for training. I've learned how to deal with unbalanced datasets and how improve binary classifiers performance. I've alse explored meaning of particular metrics used in machine learning. <p>
